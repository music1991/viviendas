Beyond the titles, I'm deeply curious and passionate about technology and how it can improve people's lives using Engineering.\nI've been working in IT for more than eight years. Since I was a kid, I loved building things; today I find in development and engineering that same creative spirit, amplified by the ability to generate real impact.\nFor the last three years I’ve been part of an Argentinian fintech, where I grew both technically and personally. My leaders have highlighted my empathy, commitment and proactivity, values I bring to every project.\nI'm currently finishing my Systems Engineering degree and strengthening my stack with Node.js and Next.js. I’m also improving my English in pursuit of excellence.\nI’m passionate about designing complete solutions: from understanding the problem and proposing the right architecture, to implementing, testing, and iterating under agile methodologies (SCRUM) with user feedback.\nIn recent years, I’ve worked on my soft skills – leadership, communication and teamwork. Training in neuroscience and psychology helped me understand how emotions, awareness and empathy enhance collective performance.\nToday I seek new challenges where I can merge my two main drives: technology and the human factor."
